# Decision Mate

This project is a simple implementation of a Decision Tree. 

The main goal of this app is to receive from the user some informations about any customer, and, using a dataset, train a decision tree in order to predict what kind of product a customer with the given caracteristics would buy.

A decision tree is not the best approach when we talk about prediciting a customer decision about buying a product, but it was chosen only for study purposes.

The used dataset is fictional, handmade only for this purpose. With a real dataset, the application should have a good precision, considering the usage of a good dataset.

As the goal of this project was to focus on the Decision Tree itself, the dataset used is not being queried from the datababse, making the development process easier in order to focus in other areas of the application.
