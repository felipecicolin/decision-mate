# About the project

This project is a simple implementation of a Decision Tree. The main goal of this app is to receive from the user some informations about any customer, and using a dataset, train a decision tree in order to predict a decision. The goal is to predict what kind of product the customer with the inserted caracteristics would buy. The used dataset is fake, handmade only for studying purposes, but with a real dataset, the application should have a good precision.
